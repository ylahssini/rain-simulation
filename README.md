# Rain simulation with React + p5
This is a simple simulation of rain using React and P5.js. I like to create effects and animation and i'm enjoyed to do it.

You can see the demo in: https://ylahssini.github.io/rain-simulation/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
